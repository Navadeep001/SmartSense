## 🧠 Problem Statement

Innovators from smaller towns, universities and undeserved regions struggle to access mentorship, funding, and visibility, while investors find it difficult to discover promising early-stage ideas outside major startup hubs. Existing incubation models remain slow, location-dependant, and exclusive, leaving a large pool of untapped talent disconnected from opportunities. There is a need for an open, digital platform that democratizes innovation and bridges this gap.  

**Traditional incubation is location-bound, slow, and exclusive.**  
We aim to make innovation **open, digital, and accessible.**
